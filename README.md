CSS JS parse delay test
=======================

This is a short Python HTTP server used to test if delaying CSS and JS objects is delaying their parsing &amp; execution.
Basically, run the server and browse to its IP on port 8002 (so
http://127.0.0.1:8002 if you're running it locally). The test page will indicate if CSS and JS parsing was delayed or not.
